# Front-end assignment at Etraveli Group

For this assignment you'll create an app for listing Star Wars movies. The data should be fetched from the following endpoint: https://swapi.dev/api/films/?format=json.


## Description

When the app is loaded, a list of the movies should be displayed as the image below shows:
![Default view](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/709159/39311980-a0bc7b08-496e-11e8-8171-5f4c04cf1bd2.png)

There should be a way to order the movies by `Year` or `Episode` as the select menu shows in the image below:
![Sort by year of episode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/709159/39311979-a09dd338-496e-11e8-9183-57ae82a511cb.png)

When clicking on a movie in the list, a detailed view of it should be displayed in the right hand side of the application. In this case, ”Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back” is chosen (when no movie is selected, a default text should be displayed instead):
![Episode V details](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/709159/39311976-a080c3f6-496e-11e8-88df-64642a3ef681.png)

Additionally, there should be a way to filter the movies by entering their name in the text input:
![Filter out specific movies](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/709159/39311975-a05fde48-496e-11e8-9078-8040572b02b5.png)

**The images above are just en example layout, but the final result should aim to have the same features, and somewhat same layout**.
